# to see the directories that R searches for libraries, from within R you can do:
.libPaths()

# If you don't have a directory named R in your home directory, this method will create one and place libraries in it down a long convoluted path.  
# Typically this isn't a big deal.
#From within R you can do:
install.packages('argparser', repos="http://cran.r-project.org")

> .libPaths()
