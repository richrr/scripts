%X The gut microbiome plays a central role in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) pathogenesis and propagation. To determine whether the gut microbiome may predict responses to IBD therapy, we conducted a prospective study with Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients initiating anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab). Disease activity and stool metagenomes at baseline, and weeks 14, 30, and 54 after therapy initiation were assessed. Community α-diversity was significantly higher, and Roseburia inulinivorans and a Burkholderiales species were more abundant at baseline among CD patients achieving week 14 remission. Several significant associations were identified with microbial function; 13 pathways including branched chain amino acid synthesis were significantly enriched in baseline samples from CD patients achieving remission. A neural network algorithm, vedoNet, incorporating microbiome and clinical data, provided highest classifying power for clinical remission. We hypothesize that the trajectory of early microbiome changes may be a marker of response to IBD treatment.

%X BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment with a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody (infliximab) has been shown to be highly efficient for patients with steroid-refractory Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the mechanism of action remains largely unknown. As monocytopenia is commonly observed after treatment with infliximab, we investigated the role of infliximab-induced monocyte apoptosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy volunteers and patients with chronic active CD (CDAI > 250) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation methods. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V staining DNA-laddering, and transmission electron microscopy. Activation of caspases and mitochondrial release of cytochrome C was determined by immunoblotting. Transcriptional activation of members of the Bcl-2 family have been analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay. RESULTS: Treatment with infliximab at therapeutic concentrations resulted in monocyte apoptosis in patients with chronic active CD in a dose-dependent manner. Infliximab-induced monocyte-apoptosis required the activation of members of the caspase-family since activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 could be determined. Caspase activation was induced by a CD95/CD95L independent signaling pathway with mitochondrial release of cytochrome C. Cytochrome C release seemed to be triggered by transcriptional activation of Bax and Bak. Monocyte apoptosis in vivo as determined by annexin-V binding and caspase-3 activation could be shown in patients with chronic active CD as soon as 4 hours after treatment with infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte apoptosis induced by infliximab may be an important mechanism that could explain the powerful anti-inflammatory properties of infliximab in patients with chronic active CD.

%X Monocytes and macrophages are part of the body’s first line of defence, eliminating pathogens by phagocytosis or by releasing a broad array of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. In humans, 3 subsets of monocytes are described in blood with seemingly different functions, the classical (CD14CD16) monocytes, the intermediate (CD14CD16) monocytes, and the nonclassical (CD14CD16) monocytes. In the intestine, macrophages can be divided into resident and inflammatory macrophages that are distinguished by low and high expression of CD14, respectively. However, the roles and function of the 3 monocyte subsets in health and disease are not fully understood. In this review, we describe what is known about the origin of human intestinal macrophages and their blood monocytic counterparts and many of their numerous distinct mechanisms influencing the intestinal immune system.

%X BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pouchitis is one of the main complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of colonic histological criteria can predict the development of pouchitis. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed 147 patients’ clinical data and performed a histological evaluation of the resected total colon using Tanaka’s criteria, which comprise the following 6 factors: ulceration (H1), crypt abscesses (H2), degree of mononuclear cell infiltration (MNCI) (H3), segmental distribution of MNCI (H4), eosinophil infiltration (H5), and extent of disease of resected colon (H6). RESULTS: The development of pouchitis and chronic pouchitis within 3 years after restoration of gastrointestinal continuity was recognized in 52 (35.4%) and 26 (17.7%) of the 147 patients, respectively. Using various combinations of each score, the H3 + H4 - H5 scores of patients with pouchitis or chronic pouchitis were significantly higher than those of patients without. A H3 + H4 - H5 score of >0.4 was a statistically significant risk factor for the development of both pouchitis and chronic pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the degree of MNCI, segmental distribution of MNCI, and eosinophil infiltration from histological criteria has utility in predicting the future development of pouchitis, especially chronic pouchitis.

%X OBJECTIVE: An inadequate host response to the intestinal microbiota likely contributes to the manifestation and progression of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, molecular approaches to unravelling the nature of the defective crosstalk and its consequences for intestinal metabolic and immunological networks are lacking. We assessed the mucosal transcript levels, splicing architecture and mucosa-attached microbial communities of patients with IBD to obtain a comprehensive view of the underlying, hitherto poorly characterised interactions, and how these are altered in IBD. DESIGN: Mucosal biopsies from Crohn’s disease and patients with UC, disease controls and healthy individuals (n=63) were subjected to microbiome, transcriptome and splicing analysis, employing next-generation sequencing. The three data levels were integrated by different bioinformatic approaches, including systems biology-inspired network and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Microbiota, host transcript levels and host splicing patterns were influenced most strongly by tissue differences, followed by the effect of inflammation. Both factors point towards a substantial disease-related alteration of metabolic processes. We also observed a strong enrichment of splicing events in inflamed tissues, accompanied by an alteration of the mucosa-attached bacterial taxa. Finally, we noted a striking uncoupling of the three molecular entities when moving from healthy individuals via disease controls to patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence that the interplay between microbiome and host transcriptome, which normally characterises a state of intestinal homeostasis, is drastically perturbed in Crohn’s disease and UC. Consequently, integrating multiple OMICs levels appears to be a promising approach to further disentangle the complexity of IBD.

%X BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are believed to be driven by dysregulated interactions between the host and the gut microbiota. Our goal is to characterize and infer relationships between mucosal T cells, the host tissue environment, and microbial communities in patients with IBD who will serve as basis for mechanistic studies on human IBD. METHODS: We characterized mucosal CD4 T cells using flow cytometry, along with matching mucosal global gene expression and microbial communities data from 35 pinch biopsy samples from patients with IBD. We analyzed these data sets using an integrated framework to identify predictors of inflammatory states and then reproduced some of the putative relationships formed among these predictors by analyzing data from the pediatric RISK cohort. RESULTS: We identified 26 predictors from our combined data set that were effective in distinguishing between regions of the intestine undergoing active inflammation and regions that were normal. Network analysis on these 26 predictors revealed SAA1 as the most connected node linking the abundance of the genus Bacteroides with the production of IL17 and IL22 by CD4 T cells. These SAA1-linked microbial and transcriptome interactions were further reproduced with data from the pediatric IBD RISK cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies expression of SAA1 as an important link between mucosal T cells, microbial communities, and their tissue environment in patients with IBD. A combination of T cell effector function data, gene expression and microbial profiling can distinguish between intestinal inflammatory states in IBD regardless of disease types.

%X OBJECTIVE: Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics. We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a case-control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD. DESIGN: Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort. The gut microbiota composition was assessed by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All participants were genotyped. We composed genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the gut: NOD2, CARD9, ATG16L1, IRGM and FUT2. RESULTS: Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus Roseburia in healthy controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic Crohn’s disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28×10-13). CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals. Roseburia spp are acetate-to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in patients with IBD.

%X OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic variations within or between levels in a biological system. We have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration, methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in pathways or complete processes. METHODS: Here we propose a new graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome, the model with gene expression data produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866. However, models of the integration with pathway, Gene Ontology, chromosomal gene set, and motif gene set consistently outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of 0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology in cancer should improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators and the effectiveness of therapies.

%X BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling of prostate carcinoma offers an alternative means to distinguish aggressive tumor biology and may improve the accuracy of outcome prediction for patients with prostate carcinoma treated by radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Gene expression differences between 37 recurrent and 42 nonrecurrent primary prostate tumor specimens were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays. Two logistic regression modeling approaches were used to predict prostate carcinoma recurrence after radical prostatectomy. One approach was based exclusively on gene expression differences between the two classes. The second approach integrated prognostic gene variables with a validated postoperative predictive model based on standard variables (nomogram). The predictive accuracy of these modeling approaches was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and compared with the nomogram. RESULTS: The modeling approach using gene variables alone accurately classified 59 (75%) tissue samples in LOOCV, a classification rate substantially higher than expected by chance. However, this predictive accuracy was inferior to the nomogram (concordance index, 0.75 vs. 0.84, P = 0.01). Models combining clinical and gene variables accurately classified 70 (89%) tissue samples and the predictive accuracy using this approach (concordance index, 0.89) was superior to the nomogram (P = 0.009) and models based on gene variables alone (P < 0.001). Importantly, the combined approach provided a marked improvement for patients whose nomogram-predicted likelihood of disease recurrence was in the indeterminate range (7-year disease progression-free probability, 30-70%; concordance index, 0.83 vs. 0.59, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical variables produced predictive models for prostate carcinoma recurrence that perform significantly better than those based on either clinical variables or gene expression information alone.

%X Antibodies to DNA and chromatin drive autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.

%X The intestinal microbiota and tissue-resident myeloid cells promote immune responses that maintain intestinal homeostasis in the host. However, the cellular cues that translate microbial signals into intestinal homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we show that deficient granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production altered mononuclear phagocyte effector functions and led to reduced regulatory T cell (T(reg)) numbers and impaired oral tolerance. We observed that RORγt(+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the primary source of GM-CSF in the gut and that ILC-driven GM-CSF production was dependent on the ability of macrophages to sense microbial signals and produce interleukin-1β. Our findings reveal that commensal microbes promote a crosstalk between innate myeloid and lymphoid cells that leads to immune homeostasis in the intestine.

%X Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium and the microbiota. We found that, in the absence of B cells, or of IgA, and in the presence of the microbiota, the intestinal epithelium launches its own protective mechanisms, upregulating interferon-inducible immune response pathways and simultaneously repressing Gata4-related metabolic functions. This shift in intestinal function leads to lipid malabsorption and decreased deposition of body fat. Network analysis revealed the presence of two interconnected epithelial-cell gene networks, one governing lipid metabolism and another regulating immunity, that were inversely expressed. Gene expression patterns in gut biopsies from individuals with common variable immunodeficiency or with HIV infection and intestinal malabsorption were very similar to those of the B cell-deficient mice, providing a possible explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans.

%X T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling in CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes determines cell survival and lineage commitment, but the genetic and molecular basis of this process is poorly defined. To address this issue, we used ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis to identify a previously unknown T lineage-specific gene, Themis, which is critical for the completion of positive selection. Themis contains a tandem repeat of a unique globular domain (called ’CABIT’ here) that includes a cysteine motif that defines a family of five uncharacterized vertebrate proteins with orthologs in most animal species. Themis-deficient thymocytes showed no substantial impairment in early TCR signaling but did show altered expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and survival before and during positive selection. Our data suggest a unique function for Themis in sustaining positive selection.

%X Although much progress has been made in the understanding of the ontogeny and function of dendritic cells (DCs), the transcriptional regulation of the lineage commitment and functional specialization of DCs in vivo remains poorly understood. We made a comprehensive comparative analysis of CD8(+), CD103(+), CD11b(+) and plasmacytoid DC subsets, as well as macrophage DC precursors and common DC precursors, across the entire immune system. Here we characterized candidate transcriptional activators involved in the commitment of myeloid progenitor cells to the DC lineage and predicted regulators of DC functional diversity in tissues. We identified a molecular signature that distinguished tissue DCs from macrophages. We also identified a transcriptional program expressed specifically during the steady-state migration of tissue DCs to the draining lymph nodes that may control tolerance to self tissue antigens.

%X CX(3)CR1(+) and CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in intestinal lamina propria play a key role in mucosal immunity. However, the origin and the developmental pathways that regulate their differentiation in the lamina propria remain unclear. We showed that monocytes gave rise exclusively to CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) lamina propria DCs under the control of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) and Fms-like thyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligands. In contrast, common DC progenitors (CDP) and pre-DCs, which give rise to lymphoid organ DCs but not to monocytes, differentiated exclusively into CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) lamina propria DCs under the control of Flt3 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR) ligands. CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) DCs but not CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) DCs in the lamina propria constitutively expressed CCR7 and were the first DCs to transport pathogenic Salmonella from the intestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Altogether, these results underline the diverse origin of the lamina propria DC network and identify mucosal DCs that arise from pre-DCs as key sentinels of the gut immune system.

%X GM-CSF (Csf-2) is a critical cytokine for the in vitro generation of dendritic cells (DCs) and is thought to control the development of inflammatory DCs and resident CD103(+) DCs in some tissues. Here we showed that in contrast to the current understanding, Csf-2 receptor acts in the steady state to promote the survival and homeostasis of nonlymphoid tissue-resident CD103(+) and CD11b(+) DCs. Absence of Csf-2 receptor on lung DCs abrogated the induction of CD8(+) T cell immunity after immunization with particulate antigens. In contrast, Csf-2 receptor was dispensable for the differentiation and innate function of inflammatory DCs during acute injuries. Instead, inflammatory DCs required Csf-1 receptor for their development. Thus, Csf-2 is important in vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cell immunity through the regulation of nonlymphoid tissue DC homeostasis rather than control of inflammatory DCs in vivo.

%X Cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system regulates host metabolism, and its dysregulation can cause metabolic disease. Here, we show that the gut microbe Akkermansia muciniphila can mediate negative effects of IFNγ on glucose tolerance. In IFNγ-deficient mice, A. muciniphila is significantly increased and restoration of IFNγ levels reduces A. muciniphila abundance. We further show that IFNγ-knockout mice whose microbiota does not contain A. muciniphila do not show improvement in glucose tolerance and adding back A. muciniphila promoted enhanced glucose tolerance. We go on to identify Irgm1 as an IFNγ-regulated gene in the mouse ileum that controls gut A. muciniphila levels. A. muciniphila is also linked to IFNγ-regulated gene expression in the intestine and glucose parameters in humans, suggesting that this trialogue between IFNγ, A. muciniphila and glucose tolerance might be an evolutionally conserved mechanism regulating metabolic health in mice and humans.

%X Although human papillomavirus was identified as an aetiological factor in cervical cancer, the key human gene drivers of this disease remain unknown. Here we apply an unbiased approach integrating gene expression and chromosomal aberration data. In an independent group of patients, we reconstruct and validate a gene regulatory meta-network, and identify cell cycle and antiviral genes that constitute two major subnetworks upregulated in tumour samples. These genes are located within the same regions as chromosomal amplifications, most frequently on 3q. We propose a model in which selected chromosomal gains drive activation of antiviral genes contributing to episomal virus elimination, which synergizes with cell cycle dysregulation. These findings may help to explain the paradox of episomal human papillomavirus decline in women with invasive cancer who were previously unable to clear the virus.

%X OBJECTIVE: Despite widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening infections and for research on the role of commensal microbiota, our understanding of their effects on the host is still very limited. DESIGN: Using a popular mouse model of microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics, we analysed the effects of antibiotics by combining intestinal transcriptome together with metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota. In order to identify specific microbes and microbial genes that influence the host phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice, we developed and applied analysis of the transkingdom network. RESULTS: We found that most antibiotic-induced alterations in the gut can be explained by three factors: depletion of the microbiota; direct effects of antibiotics on host tissues and the effects of remaining antibiotic-resistant microbes. Normal microbiota depletion mostly led to downregulation of different aspects of immunity. The two other factors (antibiotic direct effects on host tissues and antibiotic-resistant microbes) primarily inhibited mitochondrial gene expression and amounts of active mitochondria, increasing epithelial cell death. By reconstructing and analysing the transkingdom network, we discovered that these toxic effects were mediated by virulence/quorum sensing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a finding further validated using in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to revealing mechanisms of antibiotic-induced alterations, this study also describes a new bioinformatics approach that predicts microbial components that regulate host functions and establishes a comprehensive resource on what, why and how antibiotics affect the gut in a widely used mouse model of microbiota depletion by antibiotics.

%X The monitoring of transplanted hearts is currently based on histological evaluation of endomyocardial biopsies, a method that is fairly insensitive and that does not always accurately discriminate between rejection and infection in the heart. Accurate diagnosis of rejection and infection is absolutely crucial, however, as the respective treatments are completely different. Using microarrays, we analyzed gene expression in 76 cardiac biopsies from 40 heart recipients undergoing rejection, no rejection, or Trypanosoma cruzi infection. We found a set of genes whose expression patterns were typical of acute rejection, and another set of genes that discriminated between rejection and T cruzi infection. These sets revealed acute rejection episodes up to 2 weeks earlier, and trypanosome infection up to 2 months earlier than did histological evaluation. When applied to raw data from other institutions, the 2 sets of predictive genes were also able to accurately pinpoint acute rejection of lung and kidney transplants, as well as bacterial infections in kidneys. In addition to their usefulness as diagnostic tools, the data suggest that there are similarities in the biology of the processes involved in rejection of different grafts and also in the tissue responses to pathogens as diverse as bacteria and protozoa.

%X An important goal of DNA microarray research is to develop tools to diagnose cancer more accurately based on the genetic profile of a tumor. There are several existing techniques in the literature for performing this type of diagnosis. Unfortunately, most of these techniques assume that different subtypes of cancer are already known to exist. Their utility is limited when such subtypes have not been previously identified. Although methods for identifying such subtypes exist, these methods do not work well for all datasets. It would be desirable to develop a procedure to find such subtypes that is applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. Even if no information is known about possible subtypes of a certain form of cancer, clinical information about the patients, such as their survival time, is often available. In this study, we develop some procedures that utilize both the gene expression data and the clinical data to identify subtypes of cancer and use this knowledge to diagnose future patients. These procedures were successfully applied to several publicly available datasets. We present diagnostic procedures that accurately predict the survival of future patients based on the gene expression profile and survival times of previous patients. This has the potential to be a powerful tool for diagnosing and treating cancer.

%X MOTIVATION: Gene set analysis allows formal testing of subtle but coordinated changes in a group of genes, such as those defined by Gene Ontology (GO) or KEGG Pathway databases. We propose a new method for gene set analysis that is based on principal component analysis (PCA) of genes expression values in the gene set. PCA is an effective method for reducing high dimensionality and capture variations in gene expression values. However, one limitation with PCA is that the latent variable identified by the first PC may be unrelated to outcome. RESULTS: In the proposed supervised PCA (SPCA) model for gene set analysis, the PCs are estimated from a selected subset of genes that are associated with outcome. As outcome information is used in the gene selection step, this method is supervised, thus called the Supervised PCA model. Because of the gene selection step, test statistic in SPCA model can no longer be approximated well using t-distribution. We propose a two-component mixture distribution based on Gumbel exteme value distributions to account for the gene selection step. We show the proposed method compares favorably to currently available gene set analysis methods using simulated and real microarray data. SOFTWARE: The R code for the analysis used in this article are available upon request, we are currently working on implementing the proposed method in an R package.

%X BACKGROUND: Although microarray technology allows the investigation of the transcriptomic make-up of a tumor in one experiment, the transcriptome does not completely reflect the underlying biology due to alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, as well as the influence of pathological conditions (for example, cancer) on transcription and translation. This increases the importance of fusing more than one source of genome-wide data, such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome. The current increase in the amount of available omics data emphasizes the need for a methodological integration framework. METHODS: We propose a kernel-based approach for clinical decision support in which many genome-wide data sources are combined. Integration occurs within the patient domain at the level of kernel matrices before building the classifier. As supervised classification algorithm, a weighted least squares support vector machine is used. We apply this framework to two cancer cases, namely, a rectal cancer data set containing microarray and proteomics data and a prostate cancer data set containing microarray and genomics data. For both cases, multiple outcomes are predicted. RESULTS: For the rectal cancer outcomes, the highest leave-one-out (LOO) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were obtained when combining microarray and proteomics data gathered during therapy and ranged from 0.927 to 0.987. For prostate cancer, all four outcomes had a better LOO AUC when combining microarray and genomics data, ranging from 0.786 for recurrence to 0.987 for metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: For both cancer sites the prediction of all outcomes improved when more than one genome-wide data set was considered. This suggests that integrating multiple genome-wide data sources increases the predictive performance of clinical decision support models. This emphasizes the need for comprehensive multi-modal data. We acknowledge that, in a first phase, this will substantially increase costs; however, this is a necessary investment to ultimately obtain cost-efficient models usable in patient tailored therapy.

%X Many gene expression studies attempt to develop a predictor of pre-defined diagnostic or prognostic classes. If the classes are similar biologically, then the number of genes that are differentially expressed between the classes is likely to be small compared to the total number of genes measured. This motivates a two-step process for predictor development, a subset of differentially expressed genes is selected for use in the predictor and then the predictor constructed from these. Both these steps will introduce variability into the resulting classifier, so both must be incorporated in sample size estimation. We introduce a methodology for sample size determination for prediction in the context of high-dimensional data that captures variability in both steps of predictor development. The methodology is based on a parametric probability model, but permits sample size computations to be carried out in a practical manner without extensive requirements for preliminary data. We find that many prediction problems do not require a large training set of arrays for classifier development.

%X PURPOSE: A common goal of gene expression microarray studies is the development of a classifier that can be used to divide patients into groups with different prognoses, or with different expected responses to a therapy. These types of classifiers are developed on a training set, which is the set of samples used to train a classifier. The question of how many samples are needed in the training set to produce a good classifier from high-dimensional microarray data is challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We present a model-based approach to determining the sample size required to adequately train a classifier. RESULTS: It is shown that sample size can be determined from three quantities: standardized fold change, class prevalence, and number of genes or features on the arrays. Numerous examples and important experimental design issues are discussed. The method is adapted to address ex post facto determination of whether the size of a training set used to develop a classifier was adequate. An interactive web site for performing the sample size calculations is provided. CONCLUSION: We showed that sample size calculations for classifier development from high-dimensional microarray data are feasible, discussed numerous important considerations, and presented examples.

%X BACKGROUND: We consider the problem of designing a study to develop a predictive classifier from high dimensional data. A common study design is to split the sample into a training set and an independent test set, where the former is used to develop the classifier and the latter to evaluate its performance. In this paper we address the question of what proportion of the samples should be devoted to the training set. How does this proportion impact the mean squared error (MSE) of the prediction accuracy estimate? RESULTS: We develop a non-parametric algorithm for determining an optimal splitting proportion that can be applied with a specific dataset and classifier algorithm. We also perform a broad simulation study for the purpose of better understanding the factors that determine the best split proportions and to evaluate commonly used splitting strategies (1/2 training or 2/3 training) under a wide variety of conditions. These methods are based on a decomposition of the MSE into three intuitive component parts. CONCLUSIONS: By applying these approaches to a number of synthetic and real microarray datasets we show that for linear classifiers the optimal proportion depends on the overall number of samples available and the degree of differential expression between the classes. The optimal proportion was found to depend on the full dataset size (n) and classification accuracy - with higher accuracy and smaller n resulting in more assigned to the training set. The commonly used strategy of allocating 2/3rd of cases for training was close to optimal for reasonable sized datasets (n ≥ 100) with strong signals (i.e. 85% or greater full dataset accuracy). In general, we recommend use of our nonparametric resampling approach for determining the optimal split. This approach can be applied to any dataset, using any predictor development method, to determine the best split.

%X BACKGROUND: Arsenic has antimicrobial properties at high doses yet few studies have examined its effect on gut microbiota. This warrants investigation since arsenic exposure increases the risk of many diseases in which gut microbiota have been shown to play a role. We examined the association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and the composition of intestinal microbiota in children exposed to low and high arsenic levels during prenatal development and early life. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that children with high arsenic exposure had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in their stool compared to matched controls with low arsenic exposure. Furthermore, whole metagenome shotgun sequencing identified 332 bacterial SEED functions that were enriched in the high exposure group. A separate model showed that these genes, which included genes involved in virulence and multidrug resistance, were positively correlated with arsenic concentration within the group of children in the high arsenic group. We performed reference free genome assembly, and identified strains of E.coli as contributors to the arsenic enriched SEED functions. Further genome annotation of the E.coli genome revealed two strains containing two different arsenic resistance operons that are not present in the gut microbiome of a recently described European human cohort (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract, MetaHIT). We then performed quantification by qPCR of two arsenic resistant genes (ArsB, ArsC). We observed that the expression of these two operons was higher among the children with high arsenic exposure compared to matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study indicates that arsenic exposure early in life was associated with altered gut microbiota in Bangladeshi children. The enrichment of E.coli arsenic resistance genes in the high exposure group provides an insight into the possible mechanisms of how this toxic compound could affect gut microbiota.

%X OBJECTIVE: Despite widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening infections and for research on the role of commensal microbiota, our understanding of their effects on the host is still very limited. DESIGN: Using a popular mouse model of microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics, we analysed the effects of antibiotics by combining intestinal transcriptome together with metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota. In order to identify specific microbes and microbial genes that influence the host phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice, we developed and applied analysis of the transkingdom network. RESULTS: We found that most antibiotic-induced alterations in the gut can be explained by three factors: depletion of the microbiota; direct effects of antibiotics on host tissues and the effects of remaining antibiotic-resistant microbes. Normal microbiota depletion mostly led to downregulation of different aspects of immunity. The two other factors (antibiotic direct effects on host tissues and antibiotic-resistant microbes) primarily inhibited mitochondrial gene expression and amounts of active mitochondria, increasing epithelial cell death. By reconstructing and analysing the transkingdom network, we discovered that these toxic effects were mediated by virulence/quorum sensing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a finding further validated using in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to revealing mechanisms of antibiotic-induced alterations, this study also describes a new bioinformatics approach that predicts microbial components that regulate host functions and establishes a comprehensive resource on what, why and how antibiotics affect the gut in a widely used mouse model of microbiota depletion by antibiotics.

%X Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC-associated dysplasia, and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis and other complications of IPAA are common. There are scant data on laboratory markers for the evaluation and diagnosis of pouch disorders. The presence of immunogenotypic markers such as genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, NOD2/CARD15, Toll-like receptor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha has been reported to be associated with pouchitis. Immunophenotypic/serologic markers such as perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-CBir1 have been investigated as possible markers for predicting and diagnosing pouchitis. Fecal markers including lactoferrin and calprotectin seem to be useful in distinguishing inflammatory from noninflammatory pouch disorders. In our practice, we have encountered a large number of pouch patients with Clostridium difficile infection. Laboratory evaluation provides information on the etiology and pathogenesis of pouchitis, and it also helps practicing clinicians with accurate diagnosis, differential diagnosis, disease stratification, and management of ileal pouch disorders.

%X MOTIVATION: Within medical research there is an increasing trend toward deriving multiple types of data from the same individual. The most effective prognostic prediction methods should use all available data, as this maximizes the amount of information used. In this article, we consider a variety of learning strategies to boost prediction performance based on the use of all available data. IMPLEMENTATION: We consider data integration via the use of multiple kernel learning supervised learning methods. We propose a scheme in which feature selection by statistical score is performed separately per data type and by pathway membership. We further consider the introduction of a confidence measure for the class assignment, both to remove some ambiguously labeled datapoints from the training data and to implement a cautious classifier that only makes predictions when the associated confidence is high. RESULTS: We use the METABRIC dataset for breast cancer, with prediction of survival at 2000 days from diagnosis. Predictive accuracy is improved by using kernels that exclusively use those genes, as features, which are known members of particular pathways. We show that yet further improvements can be made by using a range of additional kernels based on clinical covariates such as Estrogen Receptor (ER) status. Using this range of measures to improve prediction performance, we show that the test accuracy on new instances is nearly 80%, though predictions are only made on 69.2% of the patient cohort.

%X There have been many attempts in cancer clinical-type classification by using a dataset from a number of molecular layers of biological system. Despite these efforts, however, it still remains difficult to elucidate the cancer phenotypes because the cancer genome is neither simple nor independent but rather complicated and dysregulated by multiple molecular mechanisms. Recently, heterogeneous types of data, generated from all molecular levels of ’omic’ dimensions from genome to phenome, for instance, copy number variants at the genome level, DNA methylation at the epigenome level, and gene expression and microRNA at the transcriptome level, have become available. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that uses multi-level genomic data for prediction of clinical outcomes in brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) and ovarian cancer (serous cystadenocarcinoma, OV). From empirical comparison results on individual genomic data, we provide some preliminary insights about which level of data is more informative to a given clinical-type classification problem and justify these perceptions with the corresponding biological implications for each type of cancer. For GBM, all clinical outcomes had a better the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic when integrating multi-layers of genomic data, 0.876 for survival to 0.832 for recurrence. Moreover, the better AUCs were achieved from the integration approach for all clinical outcomes in OV as well, ranging from 0.787 to 0.893. We found that the opportunity for success in prediction of clinical outcomes in cancer was increased when the prediction was based on the integration of multi-layers of genomic data. This study is expecting to improve comprehension of the molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology of both cancer types.

%X BACKGROUND: Predictors of outcome and rates of successful discharge have not been defined for patients with acute leukemia admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the US. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 90 patients with acute leukemia (no history of bone marrow transplant) admitted to an ICU from 2001-2004. The primary endpoints were improvement and subsequent discharge from the ICU, discharge from the hospital, and 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints were 6- and 12-month survival. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting outcome. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years and 48 (53%) were male. The most common reason for ICU transfer for all patients was respiratory compromise. The majority of all patients (68%) were eventually placed on ventilator support and approximately half required pressors. During the ICU course, 29 patients (32%) improved and subsequently resumed aggressive leukemia management, and 24 patients (27%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. The 2-, 6-, and 12-month overall survival was 24 (27%), 16 (18%), and 14 (16%), respectively. Higher APACHE II score, use of pressors, undergoing bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen, and adverse cytogenetics predicted worse outcome. Newly diagnosed leukemia, type of leukemia, or age did not. CONCLUSIONS: One of 4 patients with acute leukemia survived an ICU admission to be discharged from the hospital and were alive 2 months later. A diagnosis of acute leukemia should not disqualify patients from an ICU admission.

%X The gut microbiome plays a central role in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) pathogenesis and propagation. To determine whether the gut microbiome may predict responses to IBD therapy, we conducted a prospective study with Crohn’s disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) patients initiating anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab). Disease activity and stool metagenomes at baseline, and weeks 14, 30, and 54 after therapy initiation were assessed. Community α-diversity was significantly higher, and Roseburia inulinivorans and a Burkholderiales species were more abundant at baseline among CD patients achieving week 14 remission. Several significant associations were identified with microbial function; 13 pathways including branched chain amino acid synthesis were significantly enriched in baseline samples from CD patients achieving remission. A neural network algorithm, vedoNet, incorporating microbiome and clinical data, provided highest classifying power for clinical remission. We hypothesize that the trajectory of early microbiome changes may be a marker of response to IBD treatment.

%X BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment with a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody (infliximab) has been shown to be highly efficient for patients with steroid-refractory Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the mechanism of action remains largely unknown. As monocytopenia is commonly observed after treatment with infliximab, we investigated the role of infliximab-induced monocyte apoptosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy volunteers and patients with chronic active CD (CDAI > 250) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation methods. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V staining DNA-laddering, and transmission electron microscopy. Activation of caspases and mitochondrial release of cytochrome C was determined by immunoblotting. Transcriptional activation of members of the Bcl-2 family have been analyzed by ribonuclease protection assay. RESULTS: Treatment with infliximab at therapeutic concentrations resulted in monocyte apoptosis in patients with chronic active CD in a dose-dependent manner. Infliximab-induced monocyte-apoptosis required the activation of members of the caspase-family since activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 could be determined. Caspase activation was induced by a CD95/CD95L independent signaling pathway with mitochondrial release of cytochrome C. Cytochrome C release seemed to be triggered by transcriptional activation of Bax and Bak. Monocyte apoptosis in vivo as determined by annexin-V binding and caspase-3 activation could be shown in patients with chronic active CD as soon as 4 hours after treatment with infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte apoptosis induced by infliximab may be an important mechanism that could explain the powerful anti-inflammatory properties of infliximab in patients with chronic active CD.

%X Monocytes and macrophages are part of the body’s first line of defence, eliminating pathogens by phagocytosis or by releasing a broad array of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. In humans, 3 subsets of monocytes are described in blood with seemingly different functions, the classical (CD14CD16) monocytes, the intermediate (CD14CD16) monocytes, and the nonclassical (CD14CD16) monocytes. In the intestine, macrophages can be divided into resident and inflammatory macrophages that are distinguished by low and high expression of CD14, respectively. However, the roles and function of the 3 monocyte subsets in health and disease are not fully understood. In this review, we describe what is known about the origin of human intestinal macrophages and their blood monocytic counterparts and many of their numerous distinct mechanisms influencing the intestinal immune system.

%X BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pouchitis is one of the main complications after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of colonic histological criteria can predict the development of pouchitis. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively reviewed 147 patients’ clinical data and performed a histological evaluation of the resected total colon using Tanaka’s criteria, which comprise the following 6 factors: ulceration (H1), crypt abscesses (H2), degree of mononuclear cell infiltration (MNCI) (H3), segmental distribution of MNCI (H4), eosinophil infiltration (H5), and extent of disease of resected colon (H6). RESULTS: The development of pouchitis and chronic pouchitis within 3 years after restoration of gastrointestinal continuity was recognized in 52 (35.4%) and 26 (17.7%) of the 147 patients, respectively. Using various combinations of each score, the H3 + H4 - H5 scores of patients with pouchitis or chronic pouchitis were significantly higher than those of patients without. A H3 + H4 - H5 score of >0.4 was a statistically significant risk factor for the development of both pouchitis and chronic pouchitis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the degree of MNCI, segmental distribution of MNCI, and eosinophil infiltration from histological criteria has utility in predicting the future development of pouchitis, especially chronic pouchitis.

%X OBJECTIVE: An inadequate host response to the intestinal microbiota likely contributes to the manifestation and progression of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, molecular approaches to unravelling the nature of the defective crosstalk and its consequences for intestinal metabolic and immunological networks are lacking. We assessed the mucosal transcript levels, splicing architecture and mucosa-attached microbial communities of patients with IBD to obtain a comprehensive view of the underlying, hitherto poorly characterised interactions, and how these are altered in IBD. DESIGN: Mucosal biopsies from Crohn’s disease and patients with UC, disease controls and healthy individuals (n=63) were subjected to microbiome, transcriptome and splicing analysis, employing next-generation sequencing. The three data levels were integrated by different bioinformatic approaches, including systems biology-inspired network and pathway analysis. RESULTS: Microbiota, host transcript levels and host splicing patterns were influenced most strongly by tissue differences, followed by the effect of inflammation. Both factors point towards a substantial disease-related alteration of metabolic processes. We also observed a strong enrichment of splicing events in inflamed tissues, accompanied by an alteration of the mucosa-attached bacterial taxa. Finally, we noted a striking uncoupling of the three molecular entities when moving from healthy individuals via disease controls to patients with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide strong evidence that the interplay between microbiome and host transcriptome, which normally characterises a state of intestinal homeostasis, is drastically perturbed in Crohn’s disease and UC. Consequently, integrating multiple OMICs levels appears to be a promising approach to further disentangle the complexity of IBD.

%X BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are believed to be driven by dysregulated interactions between the host and the gut microbiota. Our goal is to characterize and infer relationships between mucosal T cells, the host tissue environment, and microbial communities in patients with IBD who will serve as basis for mechanistic studies on human IBD. METHODS: We characterized mucosal CD4 T cells using flow cytometry, along with matching mucosal global gene expression and microbial communities data from 35 pinch biopsy samples from patients with IBD. We analyzed these data sets using an integrated framework to identify predictors of inflammatory states and then reproduced some of the putative relationships formed among these predictors by analyzing data from the pediatric RISK cohort. RESULTS: We identified 26 predictors from our combined data set that were effective in distinguishing between regions of the intestine undergoing active inflammation and regions that were normal. Network analysis on these 26 predictors revealed SAA1 as the most connected node linking the abundance of the genus Bacteroides with the production of IL17 and IL22 by CD4 T cells. These SAA1-linked microbial and transcriptome interactions were further reproduced with data from the pediatric IBD RISK cohort. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies expression of SAA1 as an important link between mucosal T cells, microbial communities, and their tissue environment in patients with IBD. A combination of T cell effector function data, gene expression and microbial profiling can distinguish between intestinal inflammatory states in IBD regardless of disease types.

%X OBJECTIVE: Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical characteristics. We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a case-control analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of IBD. DESIGN: Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected from a population cohort. The gut microbiota composition was assessed by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All participants were genotyped. We composed genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the gut: NOD2, CARD9, ATG16L1, IRGM and FUT2. RESULTS: Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus Roseburia in healthy controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic Crohn’s disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28×10-13). CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals. Roseburia spp are acetate-to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in patients with IBD.

%X OBJECTIVE: Cancer can involve gene dysregulation via multiple mechanisms, so no single level of genomic data fully elucidates tumor behavior due to the presence of numerous genomic variations within or between levels in a biological system. We have previously proposed a graph-based integration approach that combines multi-omics data including copy number alteration, methylation, miRNA, and gene expression data for predicting clinical outcome in cancer. However, genomic features likely interact with other genomic features in complex signaling or regulatory networks, since cancer is caused by alterations in pathways or complete processes. METHODS: Here we propose a new graph-based framework for integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve power in predicting clinical outcomes and elucidate interplay between different levels. To highlight the validity of our proposed framework, we used an ovarian cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas for predicting stage, grade, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: Integrating multi-omics data with genomic knowledge to construct pre-defined features resulted in higher performance in clinical outcome prediction and higher stability. For the grade outcome, the model with gene expression data produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7866. However, models of the integration with pathway, Gene Ontology, chromosomal gene set, and motif gene set consistently outperformed the model with genomic data only, attaining AUCs of 0.7873, 0.8433, 0.8254, and 0.8179, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating multi-omics data and genomic knowledge to improve understanding of molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology in cancer should improve diagnostic and prognostic indicators and the effectiveness of therapies.

%X BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling of prostate carcinoma offers an alternative means to distinguish aggressive tumor biology and may improve the accuracy of outcome prediction for patients with prostate carcinoma treated by radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Gene expression differences between 37 recurrent and 42 nonrecurrent primary prostate tumor specimens were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays. Two logistic regression modeling approaches were used to predict prostate carcinoma recurrence after radical prostatectomy. One approach was based exclusively on gene expression differences between the two classes. The second approach integrated prognostic gene variables with a validated postoperative predictive model based on standard variables (nomogram). The predictive accuracy of these modeling approaches was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and compared with the nomogram. RESULTS: The modeling approach using gene variables alone accurately classified 59 (75%) tissue samples in LOOCV, a classification rate substantially higher than expected by chance. However, this predictive accuracy was inferior to the nomogram (concordance index, 0.75 vs. 0.84, P = 0.01). Models combining clinical and gene variables accurately classified 70 (89%) tissue samples and the predictive accuracy using this approach (concordance index, 0.89) was superior to the nomogram (P = 0.009) and models based on gene variables alone (P < 0.001). Importantly, the combined approach provided a marked improvement for patients whose nomogram-predicted likelihood of disease recurrence was in the indeterminate range (7-year disease progression-free probability, 30-70%; concordance index, 0.83 vs. 0.59, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical variables produced predictive models for prostate carcinoma recurrence that perform significantly better than those based on either clinical variables or gene expression information alone.

%X Antibodies to DNA and chromatin drive autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Null mutations and hypomorphic variants of the secreted deoxyribonuclease DNASE1L3 are linked to familial and sporadic SLE, respectively. We report that DNASE1L3-deficient mice rapidly develop autoantibodies to DNA and chromatin, followed by an SLE-like disease. Circulating DNASE1L3 is produced by dendritic cells and macrophages, and its levels inversely correlate with anti-DNA antibody response. DNASE1L3 is uniquely capable of digesting chromatin in microparticles released from apoptotic cells. Accordingly, DNASE1L3-deficient mice and human patients have elevated DNA levels in plasma, particularly in circulating microparticles. Murine and human autoantibody clones and serum antibodies from human SLE patients bind to DNASE1L3-sensitive chromatin on the surface of microparticles. Thus, extracellular microparticle-associated chromatin is a potential self-antigen normally digested by circulating DNASE1L3. The loss of this tolerance mechanism can contribute to SLE, and its restoration may represent a therapeutic opportunity in the disease.

%X The intestinal microbiota and tissue-resident myeloid cells promote immune responses that maintain intestinal homeostasis in the host. However, the cellular cues that translate microbial signals into intestinal homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we show that deficient granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production altered mononuclear phagocyte effector functions and led to reduced regulatory T cell (T(reg)) numbers and impaired oral tolerance. We observed that RORγt(+) innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the primary source of GM-CSF in the gut and that ILC-driven GM-CSF production was dependent on the ability of macrophages to sense microbial signals and produce interleukin-1β. Our findings reveal that commensal microbes promote a crosstalk between innate myeloid and lymphoid cells that leads to immune homeostasis in the intestine.

%X Using a systems biology approach, we discovered and dissected a three-way interaction between the immune system, the intestinal epithelium and the microbiota. We found that, in the absence of B cells, or of IgA, and in the presence of the microbiota, the intestinal epithelium launches its own protective mechanisms, upregulating interferon-inducible immune response pathways and simultaneously repressing Gata4-related metabolic functions. This shift in intestinal function leads to lipid malabsorption and decreased deposition of body fat. Network analysis revealed the presence of two interconnected epithelial-cell gene networks, one governing lipid metabolism and another regulating immunity, that were inversely expressed. Gene expression patterns in gut biopsies from individuals with common variable immunodeficiency or with HIV infection and intestinal malabsorption were very similar to those of the B cell-deficient mice, providing a possible explanation for a longstanding enigmatic association between immunodeficiency and defective lipid absorption in humans.

%X T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling in CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes determines cell survival and lineage commitment, but the genetic and molecular basis of this process is poorly defined. To address this issue, we used ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis to identify a previously unknown T lineage-specific gene, Themis, which is critical for the completion of positive selection. Themis contains a tandem repeat of a unique globular domain (called ’CABIT’ here) that includes a cysteine motif that defines a family of five uncharacterized vertebrate proteins with orthologs in most animal species. Themis-deficient thymocytes showed no substantial impairment in early TCR signaling but did show altered expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and survival before and during positive selection. Our data suggest a unique function for Themis in sustaining positive selection.

%X Although much progress has been made in the understanding of the ontogeny and function of dendritic cells (DCs), the transcriptional regulation of the lineage commitment and functional specialization of DCs in vivo remains poorly understood. We made a comprehensive comparative analysis of CD8(+), CD103(+), CD11b(+) and plasmacytoid DC subsets, as well as macrophage DC precursors and common DC precursors, across the entire immune system. Here we characterized candidate transcriptional activators involved in the commitment of myeloid progenitor cells to the DC lineage and predicted regulators of DC functional diversity in tissues. We identified a molecular signature that distinguished tissue DCs from macrophages. We also identified a transcriptional program expressed specifically during the steady-state migration of tissue DCs to the draining lymph nodes that may control tolerance to self tissue antigens.

%X CX(3)CR1(+) and CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in intestinal lamina propria play a key role in mucosal immunity. However, the origin and the developmental pathways that regulate their differentiation in the lamina propria remain unclear. We showed that monocytes gave rise exclusively to CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) lamina propria DCs under the control of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) and Fms-like thyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) ligands. In contrast, common DC progenitors (CDP) and pre-DCs, which give rise to lymphoid organ DCs but not to monocytes, differentiated exclusively into CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) lamina propria DCs under the control of Flt3 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor receptor (GM-CSFR) ligands. CD103(+)CX(3)CR1(-) DCs but not CD103(-)CX(3)CR1(+) DCs in the lamina propria constitutively expressed CCR7 and were the first DCs to transport pathogenic Salmonella from the intestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Altogether, these results underline the diverse origin of the lamina propria DC network and identify mucosal DCs that arise from pre-DCs as key sentinels of the gut immune system.

%X GM-CSF (Csf-2) is a critical cytokine for the in vitro generation of dendritic cells (DCs) and is thought to control the development of inflammatory DCs and resident CD103(+) DCs in some tissues. Here we showed that in contrast to the current understanding, Csf-2 receptor acts in the steady state to promote the survival and homeostasis of nonlymphoid tissue-resident CD103(+) and CD11b(+) DCs. Absence of Csf-2 receptor on lung DCs abrogated the induction of CD8(+) T cell immunity after immunization with particulate antigens. In contrast, Csf-2 receptor was dispensable for the differentiation and innate function of inflammatory DCs during acute injuries. Instead, inflammatory DCs required Csf-1 receptor for their development. Thus, Csf-2 is important in vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cell immunity through the regulation of nonlymphoid tissue DC homeostasis rather than control of inflammatory DCs in vivo.

%X Cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system regulates host metabolism, and its dysregulation can cause metabolic disease. Here, we show that the gut microbe Akkermansia muciniphila can mediate negative effects of IFNγ on glucose tolerance. In IFNγ-deficient mice, A. muciniphila is significantly increased and restoration of IFNγ levels reduces A. muciniphila abundance. We further show that IFNγ-knockout mice whose microbiota does not contain A. muciniphila do not show improvement in glucose tolerance and adding back A. muciniphila promoted enhanced glucose tolerance. We go on to identify Irgm1 as an IFNγ-regulated gene in the mouse ileum that controls gut A. muciniphila levels. A. muciniphila is also linked to IFNγ-regulated gene expression in the intestine and glucose parameters in humans, suggesting that this trialogue between IFNγ, A. muciniphila and glucose tolerance might be an evolutionally conserved mechanism regulating metabolic health in mice and humans.

%X Although human papillomavirus was identified as an aetiological factor in cervical cancer, the key human gene drivers of this disease remain unknown. Here we apply an unbiased approach integrating gene expression and chromosomal aberration data. In an independent group of patients, we reconstruct and validate a gene regulatory meta-network, and identify cell cycle and antiviral genes that constitute two major subnetworks upregulated in tumour samples. These genes are located within the same regions as chromosomal amplifications, most frequently on 3q. We propose a model in which selected chromosomal gains drive activation of antiviral genes contributing to episomal virus elimination, which synergizes with cell cycle dysregulation. These findings may help to explain the paradox of episomal human papillomavirus decline in women with invasive cancer who were previously unable to clear the virus.

%X OBJECTIVE: Despite widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening infections and for research on the role of commensal microbiota, our understanding of their effects on the host is still very limited. DESIGN: Using a popular mouse model of microbiota depletion by a cocktail of antibiotics, we analysed the effects of antibiotics by combining intestinal transcriptome together with metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota. In order to identify specific microbes and microbial genes that influence the host phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice, we developed and applied analysis of the transkingdom network. RESULTS: We found that most antibiotic-induced alterations in the gut can be explained by three factors: depletion of the microbiota; direct effects of antibiotics on host tissues and the effects of remaining antibiotic-resistant microbes. Normal microbiota depletion mostly led to downregulation of different aspects of immunity. The two other factors (antibiotic direct effects on host tissues and antibiotic-resistant microbes) primarily inhibited mitochondrial gene expression and amounts of active mitochondria, increasing epithelial cell death. By reconstructing and analysing the transkingdom network, we discovered that these toxic effects were mediated by virulence/quorum sensing in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a finding further validated using in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to revealing mechanisms of antibiotic-induced alterations, this study also describes a new bioinformatics approach that predicts microbial components that regulate host functions and establishes a comprehensive resource on what, why and how antibiotics affect the gut in a widely used mouse model of microbiota depletion by antibiotics.

%X The monitoring of transplanted hearts is currently based on histological evaluation of endomyocardial biopsies, a method that is fairly insensitive and that does not always accurately discriminate between rejection and infection in the heart. Accurate diagnosis of rejection and infection is absolutely crucial, however, as the respective treatments are completely different. Using microarrays, we analyzed gene expression in 76 cardiac biopsies from 40 heart recipients undergoing rejection, no rejection, or Trypanosoma cruzi infection. We found a set of genes whose expression patterns were typical of acute rejection, and another set of genes that discriminated between rejection and T cruzi infection. These sets revealed acute rejection episodes up to 2 weeks earlier, and trypanosome infection up to 2 months earlier than did histological evaluation. When applied to raw data from other institutions, the 2 sets of predictive genes were also able to accurately pinpoint acute rejection of lung and kidney transplants, as well as bacterial infections in kidneys. In addition to their usefulness as diagnostic tools, the data suggest that there are similarities in the biology of the processes involved in rejection of different grafts and also in the tissue responses to pathogens as diverse as bacteria and protozoa.

%X An important goal of DNA microarray research is to develop tools to diagnose cancer more accurately based on the genetic profile of a tumor. There are several existing techniques in the literature for performing this type of diagnosis. Unfortunately, most of these techniques assume that different subtypes of cancer are already known to exist. Their utility is limited when such subtypes have not been previously identified. Although methods for identifying such subtypes exist, these methods do not work well for all datasets. It would be desirable to develop a procedure to find such subtypes that is applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. Even if no information is known about possible subtypes of a certain form of cancer, clinical information about the patients, such as their survival time, is often available. In this study, we develop some procedures that utilize both the gene expression data and the clinical data to identify subtypes of cancer and use this knowledge to diagnose future patients. These procedures were successfully applied to several publicly available datasets. We present diagnostic procedures that accurately predict the survival of future patients based on the gene expression profile and survival times of previous patients. This has the potential to be a powerful tool for diagnosing and treating cancer.

%X MOTIVATION: Gene set analysis allows formal testing of subtle but coordinated changes in a group of genes, such as those defined by Gene Ontology (GO) or KEGG Pathway databases. We propose a new method for gene set analysis that is based on principal component analysis (PCA) of genes expression values in the gene set. PCA is an effective method for reducing high dimensionality and capture variations in gene expression values. However, one limitation with PCA is that the latent variable identified by the first PC may be unrelated to outcome. RESULTS: In the proposed supervised PCA (SPCA) model for gene set analysis, the PCs are estimated from a selected subset of genes that are associated with outcome. As outcome information is used in the gene selection step, this method is supervised, thus called the Supervised PCA model. Because of the gene selection step, test statistic in SPCA model can no longer be approximated well using t-distribution. We propose a two-component mixture distribution based on Gumbel exteme value distributions to account for the gene selection step. We show the proposed method compares favorably to currently available gene set analysis methods using simulated and real microarray data. SOFTWARE: The R code for the analysis used in this article are available upon request, we are currently working on implementing the proposed method in an R package.

The suggested procedure is demonstrated on a breast cancer survival data set consisting of 295 tumours as collected in the National Cancer Institute in Amsterdam and previously reported in more general papers. The main aim of this paper it to show how generally accepted biostatistical procedures can be employed to analyse high-dimensional data.

%X BACKGROUND: Although microarray technology allows the investigation of the transcriptomic make-up of a tumor in one experiment, the transcriptome does not completely reflect the underlying biology due to alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, as well as the influence of pathological conditions (for example, cancer) on transcription and translation. This increases the importance of fusing more than one source of genome-wide data, such as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome. The current increase in the amount of available omics data emphasizes the need for a methodological integration framework. METHODS: We propose a kernel-based approach for clinical decision support in which many genome-wide data sources are combined. Integration occurs within the patient domain at the level of kernel matrices before building the classifier. As supervised classification algorithm, a weighted least squares support vector machine is used. We apply this framework to two cancer cases, namely, a rectal cancer data set containing microarray and proteomics data and a prostate cancer data set containing microarray and genomics data. For both cases, multiple outcomes are predicted. RESULTS: For the rectal cancer outcomes, the highest leave-one-out (LOO) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were obtained when combining microarray and proteomics data gathered during therapy and ranged from 0.927 to 0.987. For prostate cancer, all four outcomes had a better LOO AUC when combining microarray and genomics data, ranging from 0.786 for recurrence to 0.987 for metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: For both cancer sites the prediction of all outcomes improved when more than one genome-wide data set was considered. This suggests that integrating multiple genome-wide data sources increases the predictive performance of clinical decision support models. This emphasizes the need for comprehensive multi-modal data. We acknowledge that, in a first phase, this will substantially increase costs; however, this is a necessary investment to ultimately obtain cost-efficient models usable in patient tailored therapy.

%X Many gene expression studies attempt to develop a predictor of pre-defined diagnostic or prognostic classes. If the classes are similar biologically, then the number of genes that are differentially expressed between the classes is likely to be small compared to the total number of genes measured. This motivates a two-step process for predictor development, a subset of differentially expressed genes is selected for use in the predictor and then the predictor constructed from these. Both these steps will introduce variability into the resulting classifier, so both must be incorporated in sample size estimation. We introduce a methodology for sample size determination for prediction in the context of high-dimensional data that captures variability in both steps of predictor development. The methodology is based on a parametric probability model, but permits sample size computations to be carried out in a practical manner without extensive requirements for preliminary data. We find that many prediction problems do not require a large training set of arrays for classifier development.

%X PURPOSE: A common goal of gene expression microarray studies is the development of a classifier that can be used to divide patients into groups with different prognoses, or with different expected responses to a therapy. These types of classifiers are developed on a training set, which is the set of samples used to train a classifier. The question of how many samples are needed in the training set to produce a good classifier from high-dimensional microarray data is challenging. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We present a model-based approach to determining the sample size required to adequately train a classifier. RESULTS: It is shown that sample size can be determined from three quantities: standardized fold change, class prevalence, and number of genes or features on the arrays. Numerous examples and important experimental design issues are discussed. The method is adapted to address ex post facto determination of whether the size of a training set used to develop a classifier was adequate. An interactive web site for performing the sample size calculations is provided. CONCLUSION: We showed that sample size calculations for classifier development from high-dimensional microarray data are feasible, discussed numerous important considerations, and presented examples.

%X BACKGROUND: We consider the problem of designing a study to develop a predictive classifier from high dimensional data. A common study design is to split the sample into a training set and an independent test set, where the former is used to develop the classifier and the latter to evaluate its performance. In this paper we address the question of what proportion of the samples should be devoted to the training set. How does this proportion impact the mean squared error (MSE) of the prediction accuracy estimate? RESULTS: We develop a non-parametric algorithm for determining an optimal splitting proportion that can be applied with a specific dataset and classifier algorithm. We also perform a broad simulation study for the purpose of better understanding the factors that determine the best split proportions and to evaluate commonly used splitting strategies (1/2 training or 2/3 training) under a wide variety of conditions. These methods are based on a decomposition of the MSE into three intuitive component parts. CONCLUSIONS: By applying these approaches to a number of synthetic and real microarray datasets we show that for linear classifiers the optimal proportion depends on the overall number of samples available and the degree of differential expression between the classes. The optimal proportion was found to depend on the full dataset size (n) and classification accuracy - with higher accuracy and smaller n resulting in more assigned to the training set. The commonly used strategy of allocating 2/3rd of cases for training was close to optimal for reasonable sized datasets (n ≥ 100) with strong signals (i.e. 85% or greater full dataset accuracy). In general, we recommend use of our nonparametric resampling approach for determining the optimal split. This approach can be applied to any dataset, using any predictor development method, to determine the best split.

%X BACKGROUND: Arsenic has antimicrobial properties at high doses yet few studies have examined its effect on gut microbiota. This warrants investigation since arsenic exposure increases the risk of many diseases in which gut microbiota have been shown to play a role. We examined the association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and the composition of intestinal microbiota in children exposed to low and high arsenic levels during prenatal development and early life. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that children with high arsenic exposure had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in their stool compared to matched controls with low arsenic exposure. Furthermore, whole metagenome shotgun sequencing identified 332 bacterial SEED functions that were enriched in the high exposure group. A separate model showed that these genes, which included genes involved in virulence and multidrug resistance, were positively correlated with arsenic concentration within the group of children in the high arsenic group. We performed reference free genome assembly, and identified strains of E.coli as contributors to the arsenic enriched SEED functions. Further genome annotation of the E.coli genome revealed two strains containing two different arsenic resistance operons that are not present in the gut microbiome of a recently described European human cohort (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract, MetaHIT). We then performed quantification by qPCR of two arsenic resistant genes (ArsB, ArsC). We observed that the expression of these two operons was higher among the children with high arsenic exposure compared to matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study indicates that arsenic exposure early in life was associated with altered gut microbiota in Bangladeshi children. The enrichment of E.coli arsenic resistance genes in the high exposure group provides an insight into the possible mechanisms of how this toxic compound could affect gut microbiota.

%X Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) or UC-associated dysplasia, and for the majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis and other complications of IPAA are common. There are scant data on laboratory markers for the evaluation and diagnosis of pouch disorders. The presence of immunogenotypic markers such as genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, NOD2/CARD15, Toll-like receptor, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha has been reported to be associated with pouchitis. Immunophenotypic/serologic markers such as perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and anti-CBir1 have been investigated as possible markers for predicting and diagnosing pouchitis. Fecal markers including lactoferrin and calprotectin seem to be useful in distinguishing inflammatory from noninflammatory pouch disorders. In our practice, we have encountered a large number of pouch patients with Clostridium difficile infection. Laboratory evaluation provides information on the etiology and pathogenesis of pouchitis, and it also helps practicing clinicians with accurate diagnosis, differential diagnosis, disease stratification, and management of ileal pouch disorders.

%X MOTIVATION: Within medical research there is an increasing trend toward deriving multiple types of data from the same individual. The most effective prognostic prediction methods should use all available data, as this maximizes the amount of information used. In this article, we consider a variety of learning strategies to boost prediction performance based on the use of all available data. IMPLEMENTATION: We consider data integration via the use of multiple kernel learning supervised learning methods. We propose a scheme in which feature selection by statistical score is performed separately per data type and by pathway membership. We further consider the introduction of a confidence measure for the class assignment, both to remove some ambiguously labeled datapoints from the training data and to implement a cautious classifier that only makes predictions when the associated confidence is high. RESULTS: We use the METABRIC dataset for breast cancer, with prediction of survival at 2000 days from diagnosis. Predictive accuracy is improved by using kernels that exclusively use those genes, as features, which are known members of particular pathways. We show that yet further improvements can be made by using a range of additional kernels based on clinical covariates such as Estrogen Receptor (ER) status. Using this range of measures to improve prediction performance, we show that the test accuracy on new instances is nearly 80%, though predictions are only made on 69.2% of the patient cohort.

%X There have been many attempts in cancer clinical-type classification by using a dataset from a number of molecular layers of biological system. Despite these efforts, however, it still remains difficult to elucidate the cancer phenotypes because the cancer genome is neither simple nor independent but rather complicated and dysregulated by multiple molecular mechanisms. Recently, heterogeneous types of data, generated from all molecular levels of ’omic’ dimensions from genome to phenome, for instance, copy number variants at the genome level, DNA methylation at the epigenome level, and gene expression and microRNA at the transcriptome level, have become available. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework that uses multi-level genomic data for prediction of clinical outcomes in brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) and ovarian cancer (serous cystadenocarcinoma, OV). From empirical comparison results on individual genomic data, we provide some preliminary insights about which level of data is more informative to a given clinical-type classification problem and justify these perceptions with the corresponding biological implications for each type of cancer. For GBM, all clinical outcomes had a better the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic when integrating multi-layers of genomic data, 0.876 for survival to 0.832 for recurrence. Moreover, the better AUCs were achieved from the integration approach for all clinical outcomes in OV as well, ranging from 0.787 to 0.893. We found that the opportunity for success in prediction of clinical outcomes in cancer was increased when the prediction was based on the integration of multi-layers of genomic data. This study is expecting to improve comprehension of the molecular pathogenesis and underlying biology of both cancer types.

%X BACKGROUND: Predictors of outcome and rates of successful discharge have not been defined for patients with acute leukemia admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the US. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 90 patients with acute leukemia (no history of bone marrow transplant) admitted to an ICU from 2001-2004. The primary endpoints were improvement and subsequent discharge from the ICU, discharge from the hospital, and 2-month survival after hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints were 6- and 12-month survival. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors predicting outcome. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 54 years and 48 (53%) were male. The most common reason for ICU transfer for all patients was respiratory compromise. The majority of all patients (68%) were eventually placed on ventilator support and approximately half required pressors. During the ICU course, 29 patients (32%) improved and subsequently resumed aggressive leukemia management, and 24 patients (27%) survived to be discharged from the hospital. The 2-, 6-, and 12-month overall survival was 24 (27%), 16 (18%), and 14 (16%), respectively. Higher APACHE II score, use of pressors, undergoing bone marrow transplantation preparative regimen, and adverse cytogenetics predicted worse outcome. Newly diagnosed leukemia, type of leukemia, or age did not. CONCLUSIONS: One of 4 patients with acute leukemia survived an ICU admission to be discharged from the hospital and were alive 2 months later. A diagnosis of acute leukemia should not disqualify patients from an ICU admission.
